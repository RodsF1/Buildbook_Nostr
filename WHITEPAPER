A new platform for FOSS Decentralization: Buildbook White Paper

The Problem
Today, GitHub controls the presentation layer, the distribution layer, and now the AI layer of how code is shared and shipped. 
This consolidation gives one corporation outsized control over the developer ecosystem, the open-source foundation of modern software-
risking its dependence on a centralized gatekeeper.

The Principle
A true public square for developers cannot exist on corporate infrastructure. 
To preserve freedom, trust, and innovation, the foundation must be decentralized, portable, and owned by no one.

The Solution
We are building that foundation on Nostr, an open framework for identity, messaging, and verifiable contributions. 
By separating the protocol layer from presentation and distribution, we:

1. Decentralize ownership and reduce dependency on any single platform
2. Preserve identity portability across communities and tools
3. Strengthen trust in the FOSS ecosystem through verifiable contributions
4. Empower developers to build, share, and collaborate on their own terms

One of the gaps in today's developer ecosystem is that proof-of-work is siloed. GitHub shows commits, but it doesn't travel with you. 
LinkedIn shows a résumé, but not your code. Both are centralized, both controlled by corporations.

A. Identities are sovereign (NIP-05) → your professional presence isn't tied to a corporate platform.
B. Resumés are portable (NIP-33) → your contributions update in real time and can be displayed anywhere.
C. Work is verifiable (custom attestation events) → signed records of your commits, reviews, and collaborations.
D. Recognition is open → endorsements and reviews come from peers, not gatekeepers.

The goal is to make proof-of-work censorship-resistant, portable, and owned by the developer, aligned with the Nostr ethos.

The Community
Buildbook is the living network on top of this protocol. It's where technical people already go to:
- Discover meaningful projects
- Share ideas and receive feedback
- Expand their networks beyond school or workplace 

Unlike social platforms built for engagement metrics or surveillance, Buildbook is a social infrastructure for developers, without a security apparatus attached.
We provide developers the opportunity to build things without worrying about corporate moonlighting or other tactics used to suppress freedom of expression indirectly. 

Building The Company of the Future
The next decade of software requires more than platforms. 
It requires a protocol-first public square, powered by Nostr and grown by communities like Buildbook.
Together, we are reshaping how developers meet, collaborate, and create, building a future no single entity can own. 
The future will not be taking Microsoft tools with it if the choice is presented. 
GitHub is now a Microsoft tool that is not designed to empower the FOSS/developer community. 

Final Thoughts
A social platform for technical people without a security apparatus, decentralized and built around and above the value propositions of GitHub, with new tooling
and no ownership structure upon it. 
Therefore, FOSS developer community can (and will) be able to entrust this platform (Buildbook.us) to facilitate the migration over to Buildbook from platform(s)
such as GitHub, Stack Overflow, Product Hunt, and LinkedIn.
