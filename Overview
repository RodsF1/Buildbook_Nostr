Buildbook’s protocol separates identity, collaboration events, and attestations (protocol) from UI, discovery, and
analytics (product). Nostr is the underlying framework for identity (pubkeys), signed events, and relay-based
transport. Code remains in git; protocol events carry metadata, discussions, reviews, and verifiable contribution
proofs.

Core Principles:
• Decentralization: no single entity owns the collaboration substrate.
• Portability: developer identity, contributions, and reputation move across clients.
• Verifiability: signed events + attestations link people ↔ work (commits, reviews).
• Interoperability: bridges for GitHub/GitLab/Codeberg preserve existing workflows.
